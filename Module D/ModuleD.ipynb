        "2. The operators of addition (+) and scalar multiplication (*) are closed in the set, meaning that if a,b are in V, then a + b is in V. And if c is a scalar, then c * a is in V.\n",

        "4. Addition and multiplication must satisfy the Associative and Distributive properies.\n",

There is of course a trival solution to this system where x = 0, but that solution is not considered useful in almost every case. The solutions (values of x) are called eigenvectors, and are each associated with an eigenvalue (y) used to compute them.\n",
