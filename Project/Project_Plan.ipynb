        "My problem will be to fill in missing position and velocity data of sport objects. The use-case I will focus most on will be a soccer ball travelling on a soccer field, however these methods could be used to capture other data such as tennis balls, basketballs, American football footballs, rugby balls, golf balls, this has applications to all sorts of sport.\n",

        "3. Proposed methodology / models: I will explore different methods of interpolation to fill in these gaps, including spline interpolation, Bezier interpolation, newton interpolation, and lagrange interpolation. As I delve into this project and test different models, I may add more types of interpolation that already exist or come up with my own ideas.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Expected results: The results of this study will be quite simple. I will explore different methodologies for predicting missing position data in sports. My goal is to cover several differnet methods of interpolation, and I will quantify the results by computing the accuracy with which I can predict the missing data. The success of failure of my hypothesis will be determined by whether or not the data can be accurately predicted using any type of interpolation.\n",

        "The primary language to be used will be Python because of the advent of so many Python data science tools.\n",

        "Many datasets will be explored depeneding on needs as the project moves forwards. The ones initially explored will be:\n",

        "    d. NBA SportVU Dataset\n",
        "    e. Football Player Tracking Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "While these data sets will be used and explored, the possibility of creating a synthetic dataset will also be conisdered. Many of these datasets have been used\n",
        " to create deep learning models that can predict the location of the ball based on the image. This functionality may also be used to create synthetic datasets depending on the needs of the project.\n"
